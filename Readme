SentenceSimplification is parsing a sentence into a combination of clauses, in order to analyze the significance of the sentences, or to find the main clause.

Tools:Using java and Stanford CoreNLP 3.7.0 Dependency Graph

example:
"He says that you like to swim"           [0. He says, 1. that you like to swim]
"Do you know who the US president is"     [0. Do, 2. who the US president is, 1. you know]

[1. that you like to swim] and [2. who the US president is] are the major significance of the sentences.

The numbers 1. before the clause means that the first node in this clause is on the two layer,the numbers 2. means that the first node root in this clause is on the three layer, and so on.

Chinese sentences can also be parsed in "ChineseSentenceSimplification.java".
